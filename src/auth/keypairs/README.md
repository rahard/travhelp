# notes
keys that were generated here are for testing purposes only.
they are not real keys.

There are different ways to generate keys. Different formats.
These scripts are just those. Different ways to do it.
I use this during my thinking / experimenting phase.
"genPEM.go" and "readPEM.go" are the pairs for "go_private.pem".

The others are generated by "openssl" tool.
